Ist das Versichert? from Baloise Hackathon 2016

# Idea
The idea is to have a possibility to simply check whether the new watch, table or mobile phone you bought is covered by one of your Baloise Insurances.

It will tell you against what and in what conditions your product is insured at one glance by taking a picture, and entering category, price and buy date.

Also, you can manage your inventory of things you already put in your system and look at it.

# Running Instructions
```
npm install
npm run backend
```
Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ or your mobile phone / tablet to your machine.
